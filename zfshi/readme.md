My part will contain two section:
1. one for the time sequencial model, which we tried at the beginning of this project
2. Ask-Bid model, which we done later with an accuracy of 50%

These two part will be separated into two files in latex. And the required resources(PICs) will also be under this folder. 

Make sure when you copy the latex context, download the resources.
