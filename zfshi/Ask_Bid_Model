\section{Ask-Bid Model}
\subsection{Model Discription}
In this model, instead of using closing price to predict the future price directly, we tried to predict whether the stock will be rising, still or sliding based on the behavior of handicap in a short time.

According to the common sense, when sellers are underselling, the price of the product will go down. On the contrary, when buyers are continuously offering high prices, the price of the product will go up. The same philosophy works well in stock. And all of these information can be found in the handicap of the stock.

In detail, we focus on the \emph{last volume, smallest five ask prices, largest five bid prices and the corresponding ask and bid volume}. We analyzed a continuous zeros in last volume, which means there is no deal at this time. In this period, from the up and down of the ask prices and bid prices, we are able to infer whether a seller or buyer is putting up new pending order or withdrawing an order.

\caption{Example of handicap}
\label{tbl:ask-bid}
\end{table}

In Table.\ref{tbl:ask-bid}, from the \emph{AskPrice1} column, we see that the price $6017.2$ disappears. Since there is no deal being made, we can infer that the seller withdraw the lowest price. Later a new lowest price $6017.4$ pops up, which is higher than $6017.2$. Then a deal is made at that price. In this time segment, we can infer that the seller with the lowest price may think $6017.2$ is too low. Therefore, he withdraws the old one and puts up a higher price. As the result, the \emph{last price} increases from $6015.6$ to $6016.4$.

Basically, what we do is based on handicap data, whose last volume exists continuous zeros, we predict the next \emph{last price} will be rising, still or sliding.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
Before we run our model, we have to vectorize our data to form a proper input and target for our model. As has mentioned above, we extract vector from the handicap.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{7}{|l|}{vector}                          & label \\ \hline
$v_1$ & $v_2$ & $v_3$ & $v_4$ & $v_5$ & $v_6$ & $v_7$ & C     \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Extracted Vector}
\label{tbl:vec}
\end{table}

In Table.\ref{tbl:vec}, the vector we use as the input and target is illustrated. In detail:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $v_1$ represents the length of the segment (continuous zeros in last volume)
  \item $v_2$ represents the volume with smallest ask price newly put up by sellers 
  \item $v_3$ represents the volume with smallest ask price withdrawed by sellers 
  \item $v_4$ represents the volume with largest bid price newly put up by buyers 
  \item $v_5$ represetns the volume with largest bid price withdrawed by buyers 
  \item $v_6$ represents the fluctuation range of ask price 
  \item $v_7$ represents the fluctuation range of bid price
  \item $C$ represents the variation of this segment. $1$ represents the last price goes up, $0$ represents it remain still and $-1$ represents it goes down
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Structure}
Still, we use a two-layer feed-forward network, with sigmoid hidden and softmax output neurons, which is similar to what we used in the Time Sequencial Model. Except this time, we do classification instead of regression.

\subsection{Results}
For the three classifier, the result is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
           & CE       & \%E         \\ \hline
Training   & $5.94e-1$ & $51.36e-0$ \\ \hline
Validation & $1.05e-0$ & $51.54e-0$ \\ \hline
Testing    & $1.06e-0$ & $51.64e-0$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
